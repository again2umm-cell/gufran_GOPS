  <h4>BackOffice Affiliate Network</h4>
  <p>
   Our affiliate network platform offers bidirectional integration with a growing list of leading back office systems. This solution allows ground transportation operators to submit and receive reservation data with the vast number of connected affiliates from around the world. All the data is transmitted dynamically using secure encryption channels so that status alerts, ride updates, and customer notifications can trigger instantly from affiliate to affiliate. This automation extends into the ride closeout process which is able to send trip cost information so that customers can be billed in the most expedient way possible. All features integrate directly through your backoffice system.

  <h4>Two Way Voice Communication Mobile App</h4>
  <p>
    Before there were mobile smart phones, there was the Nextel Phone with realtime 2 way voice messaging. Dispatchers and drivers loved to use Nextels because communication was instant, there was no need to place a call or type a text message. We built a great mobile app to keep that communication style alive just for when you need to ask a question or have something to say, and just like the old Nextel days, people still love to talk to each other through walkie-talkie style! Our mobile app GroundTalk delivers that experience in an affordable package for all Apple iOS devices. GroundTalk is faster for drivers and dispatchers to communicate and its as easy and safer as the press of a button.

  <div class="tab">
    Drivers need a safer way to communicate with Dispatchers that does not require them to type text or browse for canned messages in a mobile app.
    <br />
    <br />
    Using a mobile device like a Walkie Talkie not only improves direct communications between drivers and dispatchers, but makes the interactions quicker and safer.
    <br />
    <br />
    With a mobile app that allows dispatchers to quickly send voice messages to a driver or the whole fleet, and allows drivers to quickly respond verbally without placing a phone call or typing text messages, saves time and improves safety for drivers.
  </div>
  <div class="tab">
   
    <b>Using GroundTalk</b> - Walkie Talkie style communication is the closest thing to being face to face. You don't have to place a phone call, you don’t have to type a message but with the press of button you get instant reach between your operations and drivers. GroundTalk runs in the background when not in use so you can still hear inbound messages or can quickly switch to send a reply. If you don't want to hear your messages coming through your speakerphone, you can set inbound messages to appear as notifications.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Messaging Capabilities</b> - Communicate with a single driver or set up a channel and communicate with your entire fleet. Message History is maintained for your all your contacts until they're deleted. Just like voicemail you can reply to previous messages anytime. If a driver is using his mobile device with a bluetooth headset, they can hear GroundTalk and send a reply as they normally would when picking up regular phone calls. This is much safer for your drivers than texting with their dispatch.
