                    We process and store your Personal Data as long as necessary for the fulfillment of our contractual or legal obligations. Thus, we store the data as long as our contractual relationship with you as our customer obliges us to do so. After termination of our contract, we will store Personal Data only to the extent and for as long as applicable law requires. All other data will be deleted immediately when you, as a customer, unsubscribe from our Products or other services. If the remaining data is no longer required for the fulfillment of legal obligations, it will be regularly deleted, unless its further processing is necessary for the preservation of evidence or the prevention of legal claims from becoming time-barred.

                  <p>
                    The security of your personal information is important to us. Your account information is protected by a password. It is important that you protect against unauthorized access to your account and information by choosing your password carefully and by keeping your password and computer secure, such as by signing out after using the Transportation Services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    GroundWidgets follows the industry best practices to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and after it is received. Some of these standards are:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="normal">
                    <li>Encryption of certain information (such as credit card numbers) using secure socket layer technology (SSL);</li>
                    <li>Protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all customer information systems;</li>
                    <li>Definition and monitoring of IT security standards aligned with industry regulations;</li>
                    <li>Implementation of vulnerability management techniques according to which we scan and map our network, prioritize areas of importance and apply fixes and safeguards;</li>
                    <li>Application of safeguard firewalls and anti-virus tools to detect/prevent attacks;</li>
                    <li>Continuous monitoring for security risks and maintenance of patch updated infrastructure;</li>
                    <li>Security awareness trainings to our personnel.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    With regard to credit card information, we comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS") by (but not limited to) designing, implementing, and maintaining a coherent set of standards and procedures to manage risks to cardholder data – in an effort to ensure an acceptable level of Information Security risk – and by conducting yearly PCI DSS audits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We regularly review, test and update our security policies and systems in order to meet the highest standards of data security. Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Upon request, GroundWidgets will make a reasonable effort to inform you regarding whether we hold any of your personal information.

                    If you have signed up to receive marketing emails from GroundWidgets, you can opt-out of receiving future marketing emails by following the foregoing process.

                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>

                    GroundWidgets strives to meet its customers' inquiries. If you have a concern about your service or the processing of your information, please contact customer service.

                    On occasion, GroundWidgets may need to contact you. These communications are service-related and necessary for members and Guest Checkout users. You agree that GroundWidgets can send you service-related communications, such as those related to rides, transactions, your account, or security.

                <div class="p-block">
                  <p>
                    You are not legally required to provide GroundWidgets with the Personal Data described in this Privacy Statement. Further, the contractual relationship that you might have entered into with us by making a reservation for our Transportation Services does not imply any obligation to provide your Personal Data. However, you might not be able to use our Transportation Services to the full extent if you do not provide us with certain data or object to the use of these data in order to complete the transportation request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Our Legal Basis for Processing your Personal Data</strong>
                    <br />When processing your Personal Data, we rely on the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), an EU-wide legal framework for the standardization of data protection. GroundWidgets primarily processes data as a controller, for the purposes explained above under Sections 1 and 2 of this Privacy Statement. These purposes represent our legitimate interests for the purposes of Article 6 (1) f) GDPR. At the same time, some of the Personal Data we process is necessary for us to perform a contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you. For example, if you express your interest in transportation services, such as by filling out a webform, we will process the Personal Data submitted to comply with your request. This may include sharing your Personal Data with one of our authorized affiliates, who will then use your Personal Data to complete the transportation request. In addition, we are legally obliged to provide certain information to criminal prosecution or tax authorities in individual cases upon request. In these cases, the legal basis for the processing is either legal requirements (Article 6 (1) c) GDPR) or reasons of public interest (Article 6 (1) e) GDPR).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Transferring your Data outside the EU or the EEA</strong>
                    <br />GroundWidgets's principal place of business is in United States, which is a "<strong>Third Country</strong>" under the GDPR. Third Countries are generally not considered to afford the same level of protection that you enjoy in the EU, but GroundWidgets still provides an adequate level of protection for your Personal Data - decision 2002/2/EC of the EU Commission states that Canada is deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection regarding commercial organizations such as GroundWidgets. We have ensured that our service providers and affiliates have either certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and will process all Personal Data received from EU member states in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework or that they have been subjected to strict contractual provisions in their contract with us to guarantee that an adequate level of data protection for your data is guaranteed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Your rights regarding the processing of your Personal Data</strong>
                    As a natural person, you have certain rights as "Data Subject". You can assert the following rights against us under the GDPR:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="normal">
                    <li>Your right to information and access under Article 15 GDPR,</li>
                    <li>Your right to correction under Article 16 GDPR,</li>
                    <li>Your right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR,</li>
                    <li>Your right to restriction of processing under Article 18 GDPR, and</li>
                    <li>Your right to data transferability under Article 20 GDPR.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    In addition, you have a right of objection to the competent data protection supervisory authority under Article 77 GDPR, but only with respect to the data processing we conduct on our own behalf, as a controller. In the event GroundWidgets acts as a processor of your data for a third party, you must refer to the entity acting as controller to assert this right.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Information about your Right of Objection under Article 21 GDPR</strong>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <i> 1. Right of objection in individual cases</i>
                    <br />
                    In addition to the rights already mentioned, you have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to the processing of Personal Data relating to you, which is processed on the basis of Article 6 (1) e) GDPR (data processing in the public interest) and Article 6 (1) f) GDPR (data processing on the basis of a balance of interests); this also applies to profiling based on this provision within the meaning of Article 4 (4) GDPR. If you file an objection, we will no longer process your Personal Data unless we can prove compelling grounds for the processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims. Please also note that, if we terminate the processing due to your objection, the Channels and/or Services may no longer be available to you or only to a limited extent.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <i>2. The right to object to the processing of data for advertising purposes</i>
                    <br />
                    You also have the right to object at any time to the processing of your Personal Data for the purpose of direct marketing, including any subscription to our newsletters or personalized ads; insofar as it is associated with such direct marketing. If you object, we will no longer process your Personal Data in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The objections can be made form-free and should be addressed to: <span><img src="Content/images/email/privacy/datasecurity.svg" alt="" title="" /></span>
